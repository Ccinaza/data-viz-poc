## 3. **Setup & Deployment**
Each tool was deployed using Docker and Docker Compose for consistency. Below is a summary of the setup process:

### 3.1 **LightDash Deployment**
- Docker Image: `lightdash/lightdash:latest`
- Database: PostgreSQL (Containerized)
- Setup Notes: TBD
- Access URL: `http://localhost:8080`

### 3.2 **Metabase Deployment**
- Docker Image: `metabase/metabase:latest`
- Database: Embedded database for configuration
- Setup Notes: TBD
- Access URL: `http://localhost:3000`

### 3.3 **Superset Deployment**
- Docker Image: `apache/superset:latest`
- Database: PostgreSQL (Containerized for metadata storage)
- Setup Notes: TBD
- Access URL: `http://localhost:8088`

## 4. **Feature Analysis & Testing**
### 4.1 **Access Control & Permissions**
- Can user roles be defined?
- Can access to dashboards be restricted based on roles?
- Can individual data sources or tables be restricted?

### 4.2 **Sharing & Collaboration**
- Can dashboards be shared with other users?
- Can users comment, tag, or collaborate on dashboards?
- Can dashboards be embedded externally?

### 4.3 **Data Modeling Capabilities**
- Does it support semantic modeling?
- Can calculated metrics be created?
- Can relationships between tables be defined?

### 4.4 **Self-Service Features**
- Can non-technical users build reports easily?
- Is there a drag-and-drop or GUI-based query builder?
- Does it support SQL-based query creation?

### 4.5 **High Availability & Scaling**
- Can it be deployed behind a load balancer?
- Does it support horizontal scaling?
- Are there cloud-native deployment options?

## 5. **Performance Testing**
- Speed of dashboard rendering
- Query execution time comparison
- Resource utilization during peak loads

## 6. **Conclusion & Recommendation**
Based on the findings, the best visualization tool for our use case is **TBD**. Below is a summary of the strengths and weaknesses of each tool:

- **LightDash**: Pros & Cons
- **Metabase**: Pros & Cons
- **Superset**: Pros & Cons

The recommended tool is **TBD** due to its **[highlight key reasons]**. Further testing or additional considerations may be required before a final decision is made.
